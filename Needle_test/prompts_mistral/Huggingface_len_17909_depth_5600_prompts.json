Intentional moderates are trimmers, deliberately\nchoosing a position mid-way between the extremes of right and left.\nAccidental moderates end up in the middle, on average, because they\nmake up their own minds about each question, and the far right and\nfar left are roughly equally wrong.You can distinguish intentional from accidental moderates by the\ndistribution of their opinions. If the far left opinion on some\nmatter is 0 and the far right opinion 100, an intentional moderate's\nopinion on every question will be near 50. Whereas an accidental\nmoderate's opinions will be scattered over a broad range, but will,\nlike those of the intentional moderate, average to about 50.Intentional moderates are similar to those on the far left and the\nfar right in that their opinions are, in a sense, not their own.\nThe defining quality of an ideologue, whether on the left or the\nright, is to acquire one's opinions in bulk. You don't get to pick\nand choose. Your opinions about taxation can be predicted from your\nopinions about sex. And although intentional moderates\nmight seem to be the opposite of ideologues, their beliefs (though\nin their case the word \"positions\" might be more accurate) are also\nacquired in bulk. If the median opinion shifts to the right or left,\nthe intentional moderate must shift with it. Otherwise they stop\nbeing moderate.Accidental moderates, on the other hand, not only choose their own\nanswers, but choose their own questions. They may not care at all\nabout questions that the left and right both think are terribly\nimportant. So you can only even measure the politics of an accidental\nmoderate from the intersection of the questions they care about and\nthose the left and right care about, and this can\nsometimes be vanishingly small.It is not merely a manipulative rhetorical trick to say \"if you're\nnot with us, you're against us,\" but often simply false.Moderates are sometimes derided as cowards, particularly by \nthe extreme left. But while it may be accurate to call intentional\nmoderates cowards, openly being an accidental moderate requires the\nmost courage of all, because you get attacked from both right and\nleft, and you don't have the comfort of being an orthodox member\nof a large group to sustain you.Nearly all the most impressive people I know are accidental moderates.\nIf I knew a lot of professional athletes, or people in the entertainment\nbusiness, that might be different. Being on the far left or far\nright doesn't affect how fast you run or how well you sing. But\nsomeone who works with ideas has to be independent-minded to do it\nwell.Or more precisely, you have to be independent-minded about the ideas\nyou work with. You could be mindlessly doctrinaire in your politics\nand still be a good mathematician. In the 20th century, a lot of\nvery smart people were Marxists \u0097 just no one who was smart about\nthe subjects Marxism involves. But if the ideas you use in your\nwork intersect with the politics of your time, you have two choices:\nbe an accidental moderate, or be mediocre.Notes[1] It's possible in theory for one side to be entirely right and\nthe other to be entirely wrong. Indeed, ideologues must always\nbelieve this is the case. But historically it rarely has been.[2] For some reason the far right tend to ignore moderates rather\nthan despise them as backsliders. I'm not sure why. Perhaps it\nmeans that the far right is less ideological than the far left. Or\nperhaps that they are more confident, or more resigned, or simply\nmore disorganized. I just don't know.[3] Having heretical opinions doesn't mean you have to express\nthem openly. It may be\neasier to have them if you don't.\nThanks to Austen Allred, Trevor Blackwell, Patrick Collison, Jessica Livingston,\nAmjad Masad, Ryan Petersen, and Harj Taggar for reading drafts of this.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nJuly 2004(This essay is derived from a talk at Oscon 2004.)\nA few months ago I finished a new \nbook, \nand in reviews I keep\nnoticing words like \"provocative'' and \"controversial.'' To say\nnothing of \"idiotic.''I didn't mean to make the book controversial.  I was trying to make\nit efficient.  I didn't want to waste people's time telling them\nthings they already knew.  It's more efficient just to give them\nthe diffs.  But I suppose that's bound to yield an alarming book.EdisonsThere's no controversy about which idea is most controversial:\nthe suggestion that variation in wealth might not be as big a\nproblem as we think.I didn't say in the book that variation in wealth was in itself a\ngood thing.  I said in some situations it might be a sign of good\nthings.  A throbbing headache is not a good thing, but it can be\na sign of a good thing-- for example, that you're recovering\nconsciousness after being hit on the head.Variation in wealth can be a sign of variation in productivity.\n(In a society of one, they're identical.) And that\nis almost certainly a good thing: if your society has no variation\nin productivity, it's probably not because everyone is Thomas\nEdison.  It's probably because you have no Thomas Edisons.In a low-tech society you don't see much variation in productivity.\nIf you have a tribe of nomads collecting sticks for a fire, how\nmuch more productive is the best stick gatherer going to be than\nthe worst?  A factor of two?  Whereas when you hand people a complex tool\nlike a computer, the variation in what they can do with\nit is enormous.That's not a new idea.  Fred Brooks wrote about it in 1974, and\nthe study he quoted was published in 1968.  But I think he\nunderestimated the variation between programmers.  He wrote about productivity in lines\nof code:  the best programmers can solve a given problem in a tenth\nthe time.  But what if the problem isn't given? In programming, as\nin many fields, the hard part isn't solving problems, but deciding\nwhat problems to solve.  Imagination is hard to measure, but\nin practice it dominates the kind of productivity that's measured\nin lines of code.Productivity varies in any field, but there are few in which it\nvaries so much.  The variation between programmers\nis so great that it becomes a difference in kind.  I don't\nthink this is something intrinsic to programming, though.  In every field,\ntechnology magnifies differences in productivity.  I think what's\nhappening in programming is just that we have a lot of technological\nleverage.  But in every field the lever is getting longer, so the\nvariation we see is something that more and more fields will see\nas time goes on.  And the success of companies, and countries, will\ndepend increasingly on how they deal with it.If variation in productivity increases with technology, then the\ncontribution of the most productive individuals will not only be\ndisproportionately large, but will actually grow with time.  When\nyou reach the point where 90% of a group's output is created by 1%\nof its members, you lose big if something (whether Viking raids,\nor central planning) drags their productivity down to the average.If we want to get the most out of them, we need to understand these\nespecially productive people.  What motivates them?  What do they\nneed to do their jobs?  How do you recognize them? How do you\nget them to come and work for you?  And then of course there's the\nquestion, how do you become one?More than MoneyI know a handful of super-hackers, so I sat down and thought about\nwhat they have in common.  Their defining quality is probably that\nthey really love to program.  Ordinary programmers write code to pay\nthe bills.  Great hackers think of it as something they do for fun,\nand which they're delighted to find people will pay them for.Great programmers are sometimes said to be indifferent to money.\nThis isn't quite true.  It is true that all they really care about\nis doing interesting work.  But if you make enough money, you get\nto work on whatever you want, and for that reason hackers are\nattracted by the idea of making really large amounts of money.\nBut as long as they still have to show up for work every day, they\ncare more about what they do there than how much they get paid for\nit.Economically, this is a fact of the greatest importance, because\nit means you don't have to pay great hackers anything like what\nthey're worth.  A great programmer might be ten or a hundred times\nas productive as an ordinary one, but he'll consider himself lucky\nto get paid three times as much.  As I'll explain later, this is\npartly because great hackers don't know how good they are.  But\nit's also because money is not the main thing they want.What do hackers want?  Like all craftsmen, hackers like good tools.\nIn fact, that's an understatement.  Good hackers find it unbearable\nto use bad tools.  They'll simply refuse to work on projects with\nthe wrong infrastructure.At a startup I once worked for, one of the things pinned up on our\nbulletin board was an ad from IBM.  It was a picture of an AS400,\nand the headline read, I think, \"hackers despise\nit.'' [1]When you decide what infrastructure to use for a project, you're\nnot just making a technical decision.  You're also making a social\ndecision, and this may be the more important of the two.  For\nexample, if your company wants to write some software, it might\nseem a prudent choice to write it in Java.  But when you choose a\nlanguage, you're also choosing a community.  The programmers you'll\nbe able to hire to work on a Java project won't be as\nsmart as the\nones you could get to work on a project written in Python.\nAnd the quality of your hackers probably matters more than the\nlanguage you choose.  Though, frankly, the fact that good hackers\nprefer Python to Java should tell you something about the relative\nmerits of those languages.Business types prefer the most popular languages because they view\nlanguages as standards. They don't want to bet the company on\nBetamax.  The thing about languages, though, is that they're not\njust standards.  If you have to move bits over a network, by all\nmeans use TCP/IP.  But a programming language isn't just a format.\nA programming language is a medium of expression.I've read that Java has just overtaken Cobol as the most popular\nlanguage.  As a standard, you couldn't wish for more.  But as a\nmedium of expression, you could do a lot better.  Of all the great\nprogrammers I can think of, I know of only one who would voluntarily\nprogram in Java.  And of all the great programmers I can think of\nwho don't work for Sun, on Java, I know of zero.Great hackers also generally insist on using open source software.\nNot just because it's better, but because it gives them more control.\nGood hackers insist on control.  This is part of what makes them\ngood hackers:  when something's broken, they need to fix it.  You\nwant them to feel this way about the software they're writing for\nyou.  You shouldn't be surprised when they feel the same way about\nthe operating system.A couple years ago a venture capitalist friend told me about a new\nstartup he was involved with.  It sounded promising.  But the next\ntime I talked to him, he said they'd decided to build their software\non Windows NT, and had just hired a very experienced NT developer\nto be their chief technical officer.  When I heard this, I thought,\nthese guys are doomed.  One, the CTO couldn't be a first rate\nhacker, because to become an eminent NT developer he would have\nhad to use NT voluntarily, multiple times, and I couldn't imagine\na great hacker doing that; and two, even if he was good, he'd have\na hard time hiring anyone good to work for him if the project had\nto be built on NT. [2]The Final FrontierAfter software, the most important tool to a hacker is probably\nhis office.  Big companies think the function of office space is to express\nrank.  But hackers use their offices for more than that: they\nuse their office as a place to think in.  And if you're a technology\ncompany, their thoughts are your product.  So making hackers work\nin a noisy, distracting environment is like having a paint factory\nwhere the air is full of soot.The cartoon strip Dilbert has a lot to say about cubicles, and with\ngood reason.  All the hackers I know despise them.  The mere prospect\nof being interrupted is enough to prevent hackers from working on\nhard problems.  If you want to get real work done in an office with\ncubicles, you have two options: work at home, or come in early or\nlate or on a weekend, when no one else is there.  Don't companies\nrealize this is a sign that something is broken?  An office\nenvironment is supposed to be something that helps\nyou work, not something you work despite.Companies like Cisco are proud that everyone there has a cubicle,\neven the CEO.  But they're not so advanced as they think; obviously\nthey still view office space as a badge of rank.  Note too that\nCisco is famous for doing very little product development in house.\nThey get new technology by buying the startups that created it-- where\npresumably the hackers did have somewhere quiet to work.One big company that understands what hackers need is Microsoft.\nI once saw a recruiting ad for Microsoft with a big picture of a\ndoor.  Work for us, the premise was, and we'll give you a place to\nwork where you can actually get work done.   And you know, Microsoft\nis remarkable among big companies in that they are able to develop\nsoftware in house.  Not well, perhaps, but well enough.If companies want hackers to be productive, they should look at\nwhat they do at home.  At home, hackers can arrange things themselves\nso they can get the most done.  And when they work at home, hackers\ndon't work in noisy, open spaces; they work in rooms with doors.  They\nwork in cosy, neighborhoody places with people around and somewhere\nto walk when they need to mull something over, instead of in glass\nboxes set in acres of parking lots.  They have a sofa they can take\na nap on when they feel tired, instead of sitting in a coma at\ntheir desk, pretending to work.  There's no crew of people with\nvacuum cleaners that roars through every evening during the prime\nhacking hours.  There are no meetings or, God forbid, corporate\nretreats or team-building exercises.  And when you look at what\nthey're doing on that computer, you'll find it reinforces what I\nsaid earlier about tools.  They may have to use Java and Windows\nat work, but at home, where they can choose for themselves, you're\nmore likely to find them using Perl and Linux.Indeed, these statistics about Cobol or Java being the most popular\nlanguage can be misleading.  What we ought to look at, if we want\nto know what tools are best, is what hackers choose when they can\nchoose freely-- that is, in projects of their own.  When you ask\nthat question, you find that open source operating systems already\nhave a dominant market share, and the number one language is probably\nPerl.InterestingAlong with good tools, hackers want interesting projects.  What\nmakes a project interesting?  Well, obviously overtly sexy\napplications like stealth planes or special effects software would\nbe interesting to work on.  But any application can be interesting\nif it poses novel technical challenges.  So it's hard to predict\nwhich problems hackers will like, because some become\ninteresting only when the people working on them discover a new\nkind of solution.  Before ITA\n(who wrote the software inside Orbitz),\nthe people working on airline fare searches probably thought it\nwas one of the most boring applications imaginable.  But ITA made\nit interesting by \nredefining the problem in a more ambitious way.I think the same thing happened at Google.  When Google was founded,\nthe conventional wisdom among the so-called portals was that search\nwas boring and unimportant.  But the guys at Google didn't think\nsearch was boring, and that's why they do it so well.This is an area where managers can make a difference.  Like a parent\nsaying to a child, I bet you can't clean up your whole room in\nten minutes, a good manager can sometimes redefine a problem as a\nmore interesting one.  Steve Jobs seems to be particularly good at\nthis, in part simply by having high standards.  There were a lot\nof small, inexpensive computers before the Mac.  He redefined the\nproblem as: make one that's beautiful.  And that probably drove\nthe developers harder than any carrot or stick could.They certainly delivered.  When the Mac first appeared, you didn't\neven have to turn it on to know it would be good; you could tell\nfrom the case.  A few weeks ago I was walking along the street in\nCambridge, and in someone's trash I saw what appeared to be a Mac\ncarrying case.  I looked inside, and there was a Mac SE.  I carried\nit home and plugged it in, and it booted.  The happy Macintosh\nface, and then the finder.  My God, it was so simple.  It was just\nlike ... Google.Hackers like to work for people with high standards.  But it's not\nenough just to be exacting.  You have to insist on the right things.\nWhich usually means that you have to be a hacker yourself.  I've\nseen occasional articles about how to manage programmers.  Really\nthere should be two articles: one about what to do if\nyou are yourself a programmer, and one about what to do if you're not.  And the \nsecond could probably be condensed into two words:  give up.The problem is not so much the day to day management.  Really good\nhackers are practically self-managing.  The problem is, if you're\nnot a hacker, you can't tell who the good hackers are.  A similar\nproblem explains why American cars are so ugly.  I call it the\ndesign paradox.  You might think that you could make your products\nbeautiful just by hiring a great designer to design them.  But if\nyou yourself don't have good taste, \nhow are you going to recognize\na good designer?  By definition you can't tell from his portfolio.\nAnd you can't go by the awards he's won or the jobs he's had,\nbecause in design, as in most fields, those tend to be driven by\nfashion and schmoozing, with actual ability a distant third.\nThere's no way around it:  you can't manage a process intended to\nproduce beautiful things without knowing what beautiful is.  American\ncars are ugly because American car companies are run by people with\nbad taste.Many people in this country think of taste as something elusive,\nor even frivolous.  It is neither.  To drive design, a manager must\nbe the most demanding user of a company's products.  And if you\nhave really good taste, you can, as Steve Jobs does, make satisfying\nyou the kind of problem that good people like to work on.Nasty Little ProblemsIt's pretty easy to say what kinds of problems are not interesting:\nthose where instead of solving a few big, clear, problems, you have\nto solve a lot of nasty little ones.  One of the worst kinds of\nprojects is writing an interface to a piece of software that's\nfull of bugs.  Another is when you have to customize\nsomething for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs.\nTo hackers these kinds of projects are the death of a thousand\ncuts.The distinguishing feature of nasty little problems is that you\ndon't learn anything from them.   Writing a compiler is interesting\nbecause it teaches you what a compiler is.  But writing an interface\nto a buggy piece of software doesn't teach you anything, because the\nbugs are random.  [3] So it's not just fastidiousness that makes good\nhackers avoid nasty little problems.  It's more a question of\nself-preservation.  Working on nasty little problems makes you\nstupid.  Good hackers avoid it for the same reason models avoid\ncheeseburgers.Of course some problems inherently have this character.  And because\nof supply and demand, they pay especially well.  So a company that\nfound a way to get great hackers to work on tedious problems would\nbe very successful.  How would you do it?One place this happens is in startups.  At our startup we had \nRobert Morris working as a system administrator.  That's like having the\nRolling Stones play at a bar mitzvah.  You can't hire that kind of\ntalent.  But people will do any amount of drudgery for companies\nof which they're the founders.  [4]Bigger companies solve the problem by partitioning the company.\nThey get smart people to work for them by establishing a separate\nR&D department where employees don't have to work directly on\ncustomers' nasty little problems. [5] In this model, the research\ndepartment functions like a mine. They produce new ideas; maybe\nthe rest of the company will be able to use them.You may not have to go to this extreme.  \nBottom-up programming\nsuggests another way to partition the company: have the smart people\nwork as toolmakers.  If your company makes software to do x, have\none group that builds tools for writing software of that type, and\nanother that uses these tools to write the applications.  This way\nyou might be able to get smart people to write 99% of your code,\nbut still keep them almost as insulated from users as they would\nbe in a traditional research department.  The toolmakers would have\nusers, but they'd only be the company's own developers.  [6]If Microsoft used this approach, their software wouldn't be so full\nof security holes, because the less smart people writing the actual\napplications wouldn't be doing low-level stuff like allocating\nmemory.  Instead of writing Word directly in C, they'd be plugging\ntogether big Lego blocks of Word-language.  (Duplo, I believe, is\nthe technical term.)ClumpingAlong with interesting problems, what good hackers like is other\ngood hackers.  Great hackers tend to clump together-- sometimes\nspectacularly so, as at Xerox Parc.   So you won't attract good\nhackers in linear proportion to how good an environment you create\nfor them.  The tendency to clump means it's more like the square\nof the environment.  So it's winner take all.  At any given time,\nthere are only about ten or twenty places where hackers most want to\nwork, and if you aren't one of them, you won't just have fewer\ngreat hackers, you'll have zero.Having great hackers is not, by itself, enough to make a company\nsuccessful.  It works well for Google and ITA, which are two of\nthe hot spots right now, but it didn't help Thinking Machines or\nXerox.  Sun had a good run for a while, but their business model\nis a down elevator.  In that situation, even the best hackers can't\nsave you.I think, though, that all other things being equal, a company that\ncan attract great hackers will have a huge advantage.  There are\npeople who would disagree with this.  When we were making the rounds\nof venture capital firms in the 1990s, several told us that software\ncompanies didn't win by writing great software, but through brand,\nand dominating channels, and doing the right deals.They really seemed to believe this, and I think I know why.  I\nthink what a lot of VCs are looking for, at least unconsciously,\nis the next Microsoft.  And of course if Microsoft is your model,\nyou shouldn't be looking for companies that hope to win by writing\ngreat software.  But VCs are mistaken to look for the next Microsoft,\nbecause no startup can be the next Microsoft unless some other\ncompany is prepared to bend over at just the right moment and be\nthe next IBM.It's a mistake to use Microsoft as a model, because their whole\nculture derives from that one lucky break.  Microsoft is a bad data\npoint.  If you throw them out, you find that good products do tend\nto win in the market.  What VCs should be looking for is the next\nApple, or the next Google.I think Bill Gates knows this.  What worries him about Google is\nnot the power of their brand, but the fact that they have\nbetter hackers. [7]\nRecognitionSo who are the great hackers?  How do you know when you meet one?\nThat turns out to be very hard.  Even hackers can't tell.  I'm\npretty sure now that my friend Trevor Blackwell is a great hacker.\nYou may have read on Slashdot how he made his \nown Segway.  The\nremarkable thing about this project was that he wrote all the\nsoftware in one day (in Python, incidentally).For Trevor, that's\npar for the course.  But when I first met him, I thought he was a\ncomplete idiot.  He was standing in Robert Morris's office babbling\nat him about something or other, and I remember standing behind\nhim making frantic gestures at Robert to shoo this nut out of his\noffice so we could go to lunch.  Robert says he misjudged Trevor\nat first too.  Apparently when Robert first met him, Trevor had\njust begun a new scheme that involved writing down everything about\nevery aspect of his life on a stack of index cards, which he carried\nwith him everywhere.  He'd also just arrived from Canada, and had\na strong Canadian accent and a mullet.The problem is compounded by the fact that hackers, despite their\nreputation for social obliviousness, sometimes put a good deal of\neffort into seeming smart.  When I was in grad school I used to\nhang around the MIT AI Lab occasionally. It was kind of intimidating\nat first.  Everyone there spoke so fast.  But after a while I\nlearned the trick of speaking fast.  You don't have to think any\nfaster; just use twice as many words to say everything.  With this amount of noise in the signal, it's hard to tell good\nhackers when you meet them.  I can't tell, even now.  You also\ncan't tell from their resumes.  It seems like the only way to judge\na hacker is to work with him on something.And this is the reason that high-tech areas \nonly happen around universities.  The active ingredient\nhere is not so much the professors as the students.  Startups grow up\naround universities because universities bring together promising young\npeople and make them work on the same projects.  The\nsmart ones learn who the other smart ones are, and together\nthey cook up new projects of their own.Because you can't tell a great hacker except by working with him,\nhackers themselves can't tell how good they are.  This is true to\na degree in most fields.  I've found that people who\nare great at something are not so much convinced of their own\ngreatness as mystified at why everyone else seems so incompetent.\nBut it's particularly hard for hackers to know how good they are,\nbecause it's hard to compare their work.  This is easier in most\nother fields.  In the hundred meters, you know in 10 seconds who's\nfastest.  Even in math there seems to be a general consensus about\nwhich problems are hard to solve, and what constitutes a good\nsolution.  But hacking is like writing.  Who can say which of two\nnovels is better?  Certainly not the authors.With hackers, at least, other hackers can tell.  That's because,\nunlike novelists, hackers collaborate on projects.  When you get\nto hit a few difficult problems over the net at someone, you learn\npretty quickly how hard they hit them back.  But hackers can't\nwatch themselves at work.  So if you ask a great hacker how good\nhe is, he's almost certain to reply, I don't know.  He's not just\nbeing modest.  He really doesn't know.And none of us know, except about people we've actually worked\nwith.  Which puts us in a weird situation: we don't know who our\nheroes should be.  The hackers who become famous tend to become\nfamous by random accidents of PR.  Occasionally I need to give an\nexample of a great hacker, and I never know who to use.  The first\nnames that come to mind always tend to be people I know personally,\nbut it seems lame to use them.  So, I think, maybe I should say\nRichard Stallman, or Linus Torvalds, or Alan Kay, or someone famous\nlike that.  But I have no idea if these guys are great hackers.\nI've never worked with them on anything.If there is a Michael Jordan of hacking, no one knows, including\nhim.CultivationFinally, the question the hackers have all been wondering about:\nhow do you become a great hacker?  I don't know if it's possible\nto make yourself into one.  But it's certainly possible to do things\nthat make you stupid, and if you can make yourself stupid, you\ncan probably make yourself smart too.The key to being a good hacker may be to work on what you like.\nWhen I think about the great hackers I know, one thing they have\nin common is the extreme \ndifficulty of making them work \non anything they\ndon't want to.  I don't know if this is cause or effect; it may be\nboth.To do something well you have to love it.  \nSo to the extent you\ncan preserve hacking as something you love, you're likely to do it\nwell.  Try to keep the sense of wonder you had about programming at\nage 14.  If you're worried that your current job is rotting your\nbrain, it probably is.The best hackers tend to be smart, of course, but that's true in\na lot of fields.  Is there some quality that's unique to hackers?\nI asked some friends, and the number one thing they mentioned was\ncuriosity.  \nI'd always supposed that all smart people were curious--\nthat curiosity was simply the first derivative of knowledge.  But\napparently hackers are particularly curious, especially about how\nthings work.  That makes sense, because programs are in effect\ngiant descriptions of how things work.Several friends mentioned hackers' ability to concentrate-- their\nability, as one put it, to \"tune out everything outside their own\nheads.''  I've certainly noticed this.  And I've heard several \nhackers say that after drinking even half a beer they can't program at\nall.   So maybe hacking does require some special ability to focus.\nPerhaps great hackers can load a large amount of context into their\nhead, so that when they look at a line of code, they see not just\nthat line but the whole program around it.  John McPhee\nwrote that Bill Bradley's success as a basketball player was due\npartly to his extraordinary peripheral vision.  \"Perfect'' eyesight\nmeans about 47 degrees of vertical peripheral vision.  Bill Bradley\nhad 70; he could see the basket when he was looking at the floor.\nMaybe great hackers have some similar inborn ability.  (I cheat by\nusing a very dense language, \nwhich shrinks the court.)This could explain the disconnect over cubicles.  Maybe the people\nin charge of facilities, not having any concentration to shatter,\nhave no idea that working in a cubicle feels to a hacker like having\none's brain in a blender.  (Whereas Bill, if the rumors of autism\nare true, knows all too well.)One difference I've noticed between great hackers and smart people\nin general is that hackers are more \npolitically incorrect.  To the\nextent there is a secret handshake among good hackers, it's when they\nknow one another well enough to express opinions that would get\nthem stoned to death by the general public.  And I can see why\npolitical incorrectness would be a useful quality in programming.\nPrograms are very complex and, at least in the hands of good\nprogrammers, very fluid.  In such situations it's helpful to have\na habit of questioning assumptions.Can you cultivate these qualities?  I don't know.  But you can at\nleast not repress them.  So here is my best shot at a recipe.  If\nit is possible to make yourself into a great hacker, the way to do\nit may be to make the following deal with yourself: you never have\nto work on boring projects (unless your family will starve otherwise),\nand in return, you'll never allow yourself to do a half-assed job.\nAll the great hackers I know seem to have made that deal, though\nperhaps none of them had any choice in the matter.Notes\n[1] In fairness, I have to say that IBM makes decent hardware.  I\nwrote this on an IBM laptop.[2] They did turn out to be doomed.  They shut down a few months\nlater.[3] I think this is what people mean when they talk\nabout the \"meaning of life.\"  On the face of it, this seems an \nodd idea.  Life isn't an expression; how could it have meaning?\nBut it can have a quality that feels a lot like meaning.  In a project\nlike a compiler, you have to solve a lot of problems, but the problems\nall fall into a pattern, as in a signal.  Whereas when the problems\nyou have to solve are random, they seem like noise.\n[4] Einstein at one point worked designing refrigerators. (He had equity.)[5] It's hard to say exactly what constitutes research in the\ncomputer world, but as a first approximation, it's software that\ndoesn't have users.I don't think it's publication that makes the best hackers want to work\nin research departments.  I think it's mainly not having to have a\nthree hour meeting with a product manager about problems integrating\nthe Korean version of Word 13.27 with the talking paperclip.[6] Something similar has been happening for a long time in the\nconstruction industry. When you had a house built a couple hundred\nyears ago, the local builders built everything in it.  But increasingly\nwhat builders do is assemble components designed and manufactured\nby someone else.  This has, like the arrival of desktop publishing,\ngiven people the freedom to experiment in disastrous ways, but it\nis certainly more efficient.[7] Google is much more dangerous to Microsoft than Netscape was.\nProbably more dangerous than any other company has ever been.  Not\nleast because they're determined to fight.  On their job listing\npage, they say that one of their \"core values'' is \"Don't be evil.''\nFrom a company selling soybean oil or mining equipment, such a\nstatement would merely be eccentric.  But I think all of us in the\ncomputer world recognize who that is a declaration of war on.Thanks to Jessica Livingston, Robert Morris, and Sarah Harlin\nfor reading earlier versions of this talk.January 2015Corporate Development, aka corp dev, is the group within companies\nthat buys other companies. If you're talking to someone from corp\ndev, that's why, whether you realize it yet or not.It's usually a mistake to talk to corp dev unless (a) you want to\nsell your company right now and (b) you're sufficiently likely to\nget an offer at an acceptable price.  In practice that means startups\nshould only talk to corp dev when they're either doing really well\nor really badly.  If you're doing really badly, meaning the company\nis about to die, you may as well talk to them, because you have\nnothing to lose. And if you're doing really well, you can safely\ntalk to them, because you both know the price will have to be high,\nand if they show the slightest sign of wasting your time, you'll\nbe confident enough to tell them to get lost.The danger is to companies in the middle.  Particularly to young\ncompanies that are growing fast, but haven't been doing it for long\nenough to have grown big yet.  It's usually a mistake for a promising\ncompany less than a year old even to talk to corp dev.But it's a mistake founders constantly make.  When someone from\ncorp dev wants to meet, the founders tell themselves they should\nat least find out what they want.  Besides, they don't want to\noffend Big Company by refusing to meet.Well, I'll tell you what they want.  They want to talk about buying\nyou.  That's what the title \"corp dev\" means.   So before agreeing\nto meet with someone from corp dev, ask yourselves, \"Do we want to\nsell the company right now?\"  And if the answer is no, tell them\n\"Sorry, but we're focusing on growing the company.\"  They won't be\noffended.  And certainly the founders of Big Company won't be\noffended. If anything they'll think more highly of you.  You'll\nremind them of themselves.  They didn't sell either; that's why\nthey're in a position now to buy other companies.\n[1]Most founders who get contacted by corp dev already know what it\nmeans.  And yet even when they know what corp dev does and know\nthey don't want to sell, they take the meeting.  Why do they do it?\nThe same mix of denial and wishful thinking that underlies most\nmistakes founders make. It's flattering to talk to someone who wants\nto buy you.  And who knows, maybe their offer will be surprisingly\nhigh.  You should at least see what it is, right?No.  If they were going to send you an offer immediately by email,\nsure, you might as well open it.  But that is not how conversations\nwith corp dev work.  If you get an offer at all, it will be at the\nend of a long and unbelievably distracting process.  And if the\noffer is surprising, it will be surprisingly low.Distractions are the thing you can least afford in a startup.  And\nconversations with corp dev are the worst sort of distraction,\nbecause as well as consuming your attention they undermine your\nmorale.  One of the tricks to surviving a grueling process is not\nto stop and think how tired you are.  Instead you get into a sort\nof flow. \n[2]\nImagine what it would do to you if at mile 20 of a\nmarathon, someone ran up beside you and said \"You must feel really\ntired.  Would you like to stop and take a rest?\"  Conversations\nwith corp dev are like that but worse, because the suggestion of\nstopping gets combined in your mind with the imaginary high price\nyou think they'll offer.And then you're really in trouble.  If they can, corp dev people\nlike to turn the tables on you. They like to get you to the point\nwhere you're trying to convince them to buy instead of them trying\nto convince you to sell.  And surprisingly often they succeed.This is a very slippery slope, greased with some of the most powerful\nforces that can work on founders' minds, and attended by an experienced\nprofessional whose full time job is to push you down it.Their tactics in pushing you down that slope are usually fairly\nbrutal. Corp dev people's whole job is to buy companies, and they\ndon't even get to choose which.  The only way their performance is\nmeasured is by how cheaply they can buy you, and the more ambitious\nones will stop at nothing to achieve that. For example, they'll\nalmost always start with a lowball offer, just to see if you'll\ntake it. Even if you don't, a low initial offer will demoralize you\nand make you easier to manipulate.And that is the most innocent of their tactics. Just wait till\nyou've agreed on a price and think you have a done deal, and then\nthey come back and say their boss has vetoed the deal and won't do\nit for more than half the agreed upon price. Happens all the time.\nIf you think investors can behave badly, it's nothing compared to\nwhat corp dev people can do.  Even corp dev people at companies\nthat are otherwise benevolent.I remember once complaining to a\nfriend at Google about some nasty trick their corp dev people had\npulled on a YC startup.\"What happened to Don't be Evil?\" I asked.\"I don't think corp dev got the memo,\" he replied.The tactics you encounter in M&A conversations can be like nothing\nyou've experienced in the otherwise comparatively \nupstanding world\nof Silicon Valley.  It's as if a chunk of genetic material from the\nold-fashioned robber baron business world got incorporated into the\nstartup world.\n[3]The simplest way to protect yourself is to use the trick that John\nD.\nThe best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.\n Rockefeller, whose grandfather was an alcoholic, used to protect\nhimself from becoming one.  He once told a Sunday school class\n\n  Boys, do you know why I never became a drunkard?  Because I never\n  took the first drink.\n\nDo you want to sell your company right now?  Not eventually, right\nnow.  If not, just don't take the first meeting.  They won't be\noffended.  And you in turn will be guaranteed to be spared one of\nthe worst experiences that can happen to a startup.If you do want to sell, there's another set of \ntechniques\n for doing\nthat.  But the biggest mistake founders make in dealing with corp\ndev is not doing a bad job of talking to them when they're ready\nto, but talking to them before they are.  So if you remember only\nthe title of this essay, you already know most of what you need to\nknow about M&A in the first year.Notes[1]\nI'm not saying you should never sell.  I'm saying you should\nbe clear in your own mind about whether you want to sell or not,\nand not be led by manipulation or wishful thinking into trying to\nsell earlier than you otherwise would have.[2]\nIn a startup, as in most competitive sports, the task at hand\nalmost does this for you; you're too busy to feel tired.  But when\nyou lose that protection, e.g. at the final whistle, the fatigue\nhits you like a wave.  To talk to corp dev is to let yourself feel\nit mid-game.[3]\nTo be fair, the apparent misdeeds of corp dev people are magnified\nby the fact that they function as the face of a large organization\nthat often doesn't know its own mind.  Acquirers can be surprisingly\nindecisive about acquisitions, and their flakiness is indistinguishable\nfrom dishonesty by the time it filters down to you.Thanks to Marc Andreessen, Jessica Livingston, Geoff\nRalston, and Qasar Younis for reading drafts of this.December 2014I've read Villehardouin's chronicle of the Fourth Crusade at least\ntwo times, maybe three.  And yet if I had to write down everything\nI remember from it, I doubt it would amount to much more than a\npage.  Multiply this times several hundred, and I get an uneasy\nfeeling when I look at my bookshelves. What use is it to read all\nthese books if I remember so little from them?A few months ago, as I was reading Constance Reid's excellent\nbiography of Hilbert, I figured out if not the answer to this\nquestion, at least something that made me feel better about it.\nShe writes:\n\n  Hilbert had no patience with mathematical lectures which filled\n  the students with facts but did not teach them how to frame a\n  problem and solve it. He often used to tell them that \"a perfect\n  formulation of a problem is already half its solution.\"\n\nThat has always seemed to me an important point, and I was even\nmore convinced of it after hearing it confirmed by Hilbert.But how had I come to believe in this idea in the first place?  A\ncombination of my own experience and other things I'd read.  None\nof which I could at that moment remember!  And eventually I'd forget\nthat Hilbert had confirmed it too.  But my increased belief in the\nimportance of this idea would remain something I'd learned from\nthis book, even after I'd forgotten I'd learned it.Reading and experience train your model of the world.  And even if\nyou forget the experience or what you read, its effect on your model\nof the world persists.  Your mind is like a compiled program you've\nlost the source of.  It works, but you don't know why.The place to look for what I learned from Villehardouin's chronicle\nis not what I remember from it, but my mental models of the crusades,\nVenice, medieval culture, siege warfare, and so on.  Which doesn't\nmean I couldn't have read more attentively, but at least the harvest\nof reading is not so miserably small as it might seem.This is one of those things that seem obvious in retrospect.  But\nit was a surprise to me and presumably would be to anyone else who\nfelt uneasy about (apparently) forgetting so much they'd read.Realizing it does more than make you feel a little better about\nforgetting, though.  There are specific implications.For example, reading and experience are usually \"compiled\" at the\ntime they happen, using the state of your brain at that time.  The\nsame book would get compiled differently at different points in\nyour life.  Which means it is very much worth reading important\nbooks multiple times.  I always used to feel some misgivings about\nrereading books.  I unconsciously lumped reading together with work\nlike carpentry, where having to do something again is a sign you\ndid it wrong the first time.  Whereas now the phrase \"already read\"\nseems almost ill-formed.Intriguingly, this implication isn't limited to books.  Technology\nwill increasingly make it possible to relive our experiences.  When\npeople do that today it's usually to enjoy them again (e.g. when\nlooking at pictures of a trip) or to find the origin of some bug in\ntheir compiled code (e.g. when Stephen Fry succeeded in remembering\nthe childhood trauma that prevented him from singing).  But as\ntechnologies for recording and playing back your life improve, it\nmay become common for people to relive experiences without any goal\nin mind, simply to learn from them again as one might when rereading\na book.Eventually we may be able not just to play back experiences but\nalso to index and even edit them. So although not knowing how you\nknow things may seem part of being human, it may not be.\nThanks to Sam Altman, Jessica Livingston, and Robert Morris for reading \ndrafts of this.\n\nWant to start a startup?  Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nOctober 2010\n\n(I wrote this for Forbes, who asked me to write something\nabout the qualities we look for in founders.  In print they had to cut\nthe last item because they didn't have room.)1. DeterminationThis has turned out to be the most important quality in startup\nfounders.  We thought when we started Y Combinator that the most\nimportant quality would be intelligence.  That's the myth in the\nValley. And certainly you don't want founders to be stupid.  But\nas long as you're over a certain threshold of intelligence, what\nmatters most is determination.  You're going to hit a lot of\nobstacles.  You can't be the sort of person who gets demoralized\neasily.Bill Clerico and Rich Aberman of WePay \nare a good example.  They're\ndoing a finance startup, which means endless negotiations with big,\nbureaucratic companies.  When you're starting a startup that depends\non deals with big companies to exist, it often feels like they're\ntrying to ignore you out of existence.  But when Bill Clerico starts\ncalling you, you may as well do what he asks, because he is not\ngoing away.\n2. FlexibilityYou do not however want the sort of determination implied by phrases\nlike \"don't give up on your dreams.\"  The world of startups is so\nunpredictable that you need to be able to modify your dreams on the\nfly.  The best metaphor I've found for the combination of determination\nand flexibility you need is a running back.  \nHe's determined to get\ndownfield, but at any given moment he may need to go sideways or\neven backwards to get there.The current record holder for flexibility may be Daniel Gross of\nGreplin.  He applied to YC with \nsome bad ecommerce idea.  We told\nhim we'd fund him if he did something else.  He thought for a second,\nand said ok.  He then went through two more ideas before settling\non Greplin.  He'd only been working on it for a couple days when\nhe presented to investors at Demo Day, but he got a lot of interest.\nHe always seems to land on his feet.\n3. ImaginationIntelligence does matter a lot of course.  It seems like the type\nthat matters most is imagination.  It's not so important to be able\nto solve predefined problems quickly as to be able to come up with\nsurprising new ideas.  In the startup world, most good ideas \nseem\nbad initially.  If they were obviously good, someone would already\nbe doing them.  So you need the kind of intelligence that produces\nideas with just the right level of craziness.Airbnb is that kind of idea.  \nIn fact, when we funded Airbnb, we\nthought it was too crazy.  We couldn't believe large numbers of\npeople would want to stay in other people's places.  We funded them\nbecause we liked the founders so much.  As soon as we heard they'd\nbeen supporting themselves by selling Obama and McCain branded\nbreakfast cereal, they were in.  And it turned out the idea was on\nthe right side of crazy after all.\n4. NaughtinessThough the most successful founders are usually good people, they\ntend to have a piratical gleam in their eye.  They're not Goody\nTwo-Shoes type good.  Morally, they care about getting the big\nquestions right, but not about observing proprieties.  That's why\nI'd use the word naughty rather than evil.  They delight in \nbreaking\nrules, but not rules that matter.  This quality may be redundant\nthough; it may be implied by imagination.Sam Altman of Loopt \nis one of the most successful alumni, so we\nasked him what question we could put on the Y Combinator application\nthat would help us discover more people like him.  He said to ask\nabout a time when they'd hacked something to their advantage\u2014hacked in the sense of beating the system, not breaking into\ncomputers.  It has become one of the questions we pay most attention\nto when judging applications.\n5. FriendshipEmpirically it seems to be hard to start a startup with just \none\nfounder.  Most of the big successes have two or three.  And the\nrelationship between the founders has to be strong.  They must\ngenuinely like one another, and work well together.  Startups do\nto the relationship between the founders what a dog does to a sock:\nif it can be pulled apart, it will be.Emmett Shear and Justin Kan of Justin.tv \nare a good example of close\nfriends who work well together.  They've known each other since\nsecond grade.  They can practically read one another's minds.  I'm\nsure they argue, like all founders, but I have never once sensed\nany unresolved tension between them.Thanks to Jessica Livingston and Chris Steiner for reading drafts of this.January 2012A few hours before the Yahoo acquisition was announced in June 1998\nI took a snapshot of Viaweb's\nsite.  I thought it might be interesting to look at one day.The first thing one notices is is how tiny the pages are.  Screens\nwere a lot smaller in 1998.  If I remember correctly, our frontpage\nused to just fit in the size window people typically used then.Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years in the future) had few fonts\nand they weren't antialiased.  If you wanted to make pages that\nlooked good, you had to render display text as images.You may notice a certain similarity between the Viaweb and Y Combinator logos.  We did that\nas an inside joke when we started YC.  Considering how basic a red\ncircle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started Viaweb how\nfew other companies used one as their logo.  A bit later I realized\nwhy.On the Company\npage you'll notice a mysterious individual called John McArtyem.\nRobert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after the \nWorm that he\ndidn't want his name on the site.  I managed to get him to agree\nto a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.  He has\nsince relaxed a bit\non that point.Trevor graduated at about the same time the acquisition closed, so in the\ncourse of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student to millionaire\nPhD.  The culmination of my career as a writer of press releases\nwas one celebrating\nhis graduation, illustrated with a drawing I did of him during\na meeting.(Trevor also appears as Trevino\nBagwell in our directory of web designers merchants could hire\nto build stores for them.  We inserted him as a ringer in case some\ncompetitor tried to spam our web designers.   We assumed his logo\nwould deter any actual customers, but it did not.)Back in the 90s, to get users you had to get mentioned in magazines\nand newspapers.  There were not the same ways to get found online\nthat there are today.  So we used to pay a PR\nfirm $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in the press.  Fortunately\nreporters liked\nus.In our advice about\ngetting traffic from search engines (I don't think the term SEO\nhad been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that matter: Yahoo,\nAltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and HotBot.  Notice\nanything missing?  Google was incorporated that September.We supported online transactions via a company called \nCybercash,\nsince if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten up in product\ncomparisons.  But Cybercash was so bad and most stores' order volumes\nwere so low that it was better if merchants processed orders like phone orders.  We had a page in our site trying to talk merchants\nout of doing real time authorizations.The whole site was organized like a funnel, directing people to the\ntest drive.\nIt was a novel thing to be able to try out software online.  We put\ncgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about how our\nsoftware worked.We had some well\nknown users.  Needless to say, Frederick's of Hollywood got the\nmost traffic.  We charged a flat fee of $300/month for big stores,\nso it was a little alarming to have users who got lots of traffic.\nI once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in bandwidth,\nand it was about $300/month.Since we hosted all the stores, which together were getting just\nover 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we consumed what\nat the time seemed a lot of bandwidth.  We had 2 T1s (3 Mb/sec)\ncoming into our offices.  In those days there was no AWS.  Even\ncolocating servers seemed too risky, considering how often things\nwent wrong with them.  So we had our servers in our offices.  Or\nmore precisely, in Trevor's office.  In return for the unique\nprivilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he had to\nshare it with 6 shrieking tower servers.  His office was nicknamed\nthe Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated.  Most days his\nstack of window air conditioners could keep up.For describing pages, we had a template language called RTML, which\nsupposedly stood for something, but which in fact I named after\nRtm.  RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and libraries,\nand concealed under a structure editor that made it look like it\nhad syntax.Since we did continuous releases, our software didn't actually have\nversions.  But in those days the trade press expected versions, so\nwe made them up.  If we wanted to get lots of attention, we made\nthe version number an\ninteger.  That \"version 4.0\" icon was generated by our own\nbutton generator, incidentally.  The whole Viaweb site was made\nwith our software, even though it wasn't an online store, because\nwe wanted to experience what our users did.At the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping search\nengine called Shopfind.  It\nwas pretty advanced for the time.  It had a programmable crawler\nthat could crawl most of the different stores online and pick out\nthe products.October 2015When I talk to a startup that's been operating for more than 8 or\n9 months, the first thing I want to know is almost always the same.\nAssuming their expenses remain constant and their revenue growth\nis what it has been over the last several months, do they make it to\nprofitability on the money they have left?  Or to put it more\ndramatically, by default do they live or die?The startling thing is how often the founders themselves don't know.\nHalf the founders I talk to don't know whether they're default alive\nor default dead.If you're among that number, Trevor Blackwell has made a handy\ncalculator you can use to find out.The reason I want to know first whether a startup is default alive\nor default dead is that the rest of the conversation depends on the\nanswer.  If the company is default alive, we can talk about ambitious\nnew things they could do.  If it's default dead, we probably need\nto talk about how to save it.  We know the current trajectory ends\nbadly.  How can they get off that trajectory?Why do so few founders know whether they're default alive or default\ndead?  Mainly, I think, because they're not used to asking that.\nIt's not a question that makes sense to ask early on, any more than\nit makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to support\nhimself.  But as the company grows older, the question switches from\nmeaningless to critical.  That kind of switch often takes people\nby surprise.I propose the following solution: instead of starting to ask too\nlate whether you're default alive or default dead, start asking too\nearly.  It's hard to say precisely when the question switches\npolarity.  But it's probably not that dangerous to start worrying\ntoo early that you're default dead, whereas it's very dangerous to\nstart worrying too late.The reason is a phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the\nfatal pinch.\nThe fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not enough\ntime to fix it.  And the way founders end up in it is by not realizing\nthat's where they're headed.There is another reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're\ndefault alive or default dead: they assume it will be easy to raise\nmore money.  But that assumption is often false, and worse still, the\nmore you depend on it, the falser it becomes.Maybe it will help to separate facts from hopes. Instead of thinking\nof the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate the components.\nSay \"We're default dead, but we're counting on investors to save\nus.\" Maybe as you say that, it will set off the same alarms in your\nhead that it does in mine.  And if you set off the alarms sufficiently\nearly, you may be able to avoid the fatal pinch.It would be safe to be default dead if you could count on investors\nsaving you.  As a rule their interest is a function of\ngrowth.  If you have steep revenue growth, say over 5x a year, you\ncan start to count on investors being interested even if you're not\nprofitable.\n[1]\nBut investors are so fickle that you can never\ndo more than start to count on them.  Sometimes something about your\nbusiness will spook investors even if your growth is great.  So no\nmatter how good your growth is, you can never safely treat fundraising\nas more than a plan A. You should always have a plan B as well: you\nshould know (as in write down) precisely what you'll need to do to\nsurvive if you can't raise more money, and precisely when you'll \nhave to switch to plan B if plan A isn't working.In any case, growing fast versus operating cheaply is far from the\nsharp dichotomy many founders assume it to be.  In practice there\nis surprisingly little connection between how much a startup spends\nand how fast it grows.  When a startup grows fast, it's usually\nbecause the product hits a nerve, in the sense of hitting some big\nneed straight on.  When a startup spends a lot, it's usually because\nthe product is expensive to develop or sell, or simply because\nthey're wasteful.If you're paying attention, you'll be asking at this point not just\nhow to avoid the fatal pinch, but how to avoid being default dead.\nThat one is easy: don't hire too fast.  Hiring too fast is by far\nthe biggest killer of startups that raise money.\n[2]Founders tell themselves they need to hire in order to grow.  But\nmost err on the side of overestimating this need rather than\nunderestimating it.  Why?  Partly because there's so much work to\ndo.  Naive founders think that if they can just hire enough\npeople, it will all get done.  Partly because successful startups have\nlots of employees, so it seems like that's what one does in order\nto be successful.  In fact the large staffs of successful startups\nare probably more the effect of growth than the cause.  And\npartly because when founders have slow growth they don't want to\nface what is usually the real reason: the product is not appealing\nenough.Plus founders who've just raised money are often encouraged to\noverhire by the VCs who funded them.  Kill-or-cure strategies are\noptimal for VCs because they're protected by the portfolio effect.\nVCs want to blow you up, in one sense of the phrase or the other.\nBut as a founder your incentives are different.  You want above all\nto survive.\n[3]Here's a common way startups die.  They make something moderately\nappealing and have decent initial growth. They raise their first\nround fairly easily, because the founders seem smart and the idea\nsounds plausible. But because the product is only moderately\nappealing, growth is ok but not great.  The founders convince\nthemselves that hiring a bunch of people is the way to boost growth.\nTheir investors agree.  But (because the product is only moderately\nappealing) the growth never comes.  Now they're rapidly running out\nof runway.  They hope further investment will save them. But because\nthey have high expenses and slow growth, they're now unappealing\nto investors. They're unable to raise more, and the company dies.What the company should have done is address the fundamental problem:\nthat the product is only moderately appealing.  Hiring people is\nrarely the way to fix that.  More often than not it makes it harder.\nAt this early stage, the product needs to evolve more than to be\n\"built out,\" and that's usually easier with fewer people.\n[4]Asking whether you're default alive or default dead may save you\nfrom this.  Maybe the alarm bells it sets off will counteract the\nforces that push you to overhire.  Instead you'll be compelled to\nseek growth in other ways. For example, by doing\nthings that don't scale, or by redesigning the product in the\nway only founders can.\nAnd for many if not most startups, these paths to growth will be\nthe ones that actually work.Airbnb waited 4 months after raising money at the end of Y\u00a0Combinator\nbefore they hired their first employee.  In the meantime the founders\nwere terribly overworked.  But they were overworked evolving Airbnb\ninto the astonishingly successful organism it is now.Notes[1]\nSteep usage growth will also interest investors.  Revenue\nwill ultimately be a constant multiple of usage, so x% usage growth\npredicts x% revenue growth.  But in practice investors discount\nmerely predicted revenue, so if you're measuring usage you need a\nhigher growth rate to impress investors.[2]\nStartups that don't raise money are saved from hiring too\nfast because they can't afford to. But that doesn't mean you should\navoid raising money in order to avoid this problem, any more than\nthat total abstinence is the only way to avoid becoming an alcoholic.[3]\nI would not be surprised if VCs' tendency to push founders\nto overhire is not even in their own interest.  They don't know how\nmany of the companies that get killed by overspending might have\ndone well if they'd survived.

Get funded by\nY Combinator.\n\n\n\n\nOctober 2010After barely changing at all for decades, the startup funding\nbusiness is now in what could, at least by comparison, be called\nturmoil.  At Y Combinator we've seen dramatic changes in the funding\nenvironment for startups.  Fortunately one of them is much higher\nvaluations.The trends we've been seeing are probably not YC-specific.  I wish\nI could say they were, but the main cause is probably just that we\nsee trends first\u2014partly because the startups we fund are very\nplugged into the Valley and are quick to take advantage of anything\nnew, and partly because we fund so many that we have enough data\npoints to see patterns clearly.What we're seeing now, everyone's probably going to be seeing in\nthe next couple years.  So I'm going to explain what we're seeing,\nand what that will mean for you if you try to raise money.Super-AngelsLet me start by describing what the world of startup funding used\nto look like.  There used to be two sharply differentiated types\nof investors: angels and venture capitalists.  Angels are individual\nrich people who invest small amounts of their own money, while VCs\nare employees of funds that invest large amounts of other people's.For decades there were just those two types of investors, but now\na third type has appeared halfway between them: the so-called\nsuper-angels. \n[1]\n  And VCs have been provoked by their arrival\ninto making a lot of angel-style investments themselves.  So the\npreviously sharp line between angels and VCs has become hopelessly\nblurred.There used to be a no man's land between angels and VCs.  Angels\nwould invest $20k to $50k apiece, and VCs usually a million or more.\nSo an angel round meant a collection of angel investments that\ncombined to maybe $200k, and a VC round meant a series A round in\nwhich a single VC fund (or occasionally two) invested $1-5 million.The no man's land between angels and VCs was a very inconvenient\none for startups, because it coincided with the amount many wanted\nto raise.  Most startups coming out of Demo Day wanted to raise\naround $400k.  But it was a pain to stitch together that much out\nof angel investments, and most VCs weren't interested in investments\nso small.  That's the fundamental reason the super-angels have\nappeared.  They're responding to the market.The arrival of a new type of investor is big news for startups,\nbecause there used to be only two and they rarely competed with one\nanother.  Super-angels compete with both angels and VCs.  That's\ngoing to change the rules about how to raise money.  I don't know\nyet what the new rules will be, but it looks like most of the changes\nwill be for the better.A super-angel has some of the qualities of an angel, and some of\nthe qualities of a VC.  They're usually individuals, like angels.\nIn fact many of the current super-angels were initially angels of\nthe classic type.  But like VCs, they invest other people's money.\nThis allows them to invest larger amounts than angels:  a typical\nsuper-angel investment is currently about $100k.  They make investment\ndecisions quickly, like angels.  And they make a lot more investments\nper partner than VCs\u2014up to 10 times as many.The fact that super-angels invest other people's money makes them\ndoubly alarming to VCs. They don't just compete for startups; they\nalso compete for investors.  What super-angels really are is a new\nform of fast-moving, lightweight VC fund.   And those of us in the\ntechnology world know what usually happens when something comes\nalong that can be described in terms like that.  Usually it's the\nreplacement.Will it be?  As of now, few of the startups that take money from\nsuper-angels are ruling out taking VC money.  They're just postponing\nit.  But that's still a problem for VCs.  Some of the startups that\npostpone raising VC money may do so well on the angel money they\nraise that they never bother to raise more.  And those who do raise\nVC rounds will be able to get higher valuations when they do.  If\nthe best startups get 10x higher valuations when they raise series\nA rounds, that would cut VCs' returns from winners at least tenfold.\n[2]So I think VC funds are seriously threatened by the super-angels.\nBut one thing that may save them to some extent is the uneven\ndistribution of startup outcomes: practically all the returns are\nconcentrated in a few big successes.  The expected value of a startup\nis the percentage chance it's Google.  So to the extent that winning\nis a matter of absolute returns, the super-angels could win practically\nall the battles for individual startups and yet lose the war, if\nthey merely failed to get those few big winners.  And there's a\nchance that could happen, because the top VC funds have better\nbrands, and can also do more for their portfolio companies.  \n[3]Because super-angels make more investments per partner, they have\nless partner per investment.  They can't pay as much attention to\nyou as a VC on your board could.  How much is that extra attention\nworth?  It will vary enormously from one partner to another.  There's\nno consensus yet in the general case.  So for now this is something\nstartups are deciding individually.Till now, VCs' claims about how much value they added were sort of\nlike the government's.  Maybe they made you feel better, but you\nhad no choice in the matter, if you needed money on the scale only\nVCs could supply.  Now that VCs have competitors, that's going to\nput a market price on the help they offer.  The interesting thing\nis, no one knows yet what it will be.Do startups that want to get really big need the sort of advice and\nconnections only the top VCs can supply?  Or would super-angel money\ndo just as well?  The VCs will say you need them, and the super-angels\nwill say you don't.  But the truth is, no one knows yet, not even\nthe VCs and super-angels themselves.   All the super-angels know\nis that their new model seems promising enough to be worth trying,\nand all the VCs know is that it seems promising enough to worry\nabout.RoundsWhatever the outcome, the conflict between VCs and super-angels is\ngood news for founders.  And not just for the obvious reason that\nmore competition for deals means better terms.  The whole shape of\ndeals is changing.One of the biggest differences between angels and VCs is the amount\nof your company they want.  VCs want a lot.  In a series A round\nthey want a third of your company, if they can get it.  They don't\ncare much how much they pay for it, but they want a lot because the\nnumber of series A investments they can do is so small.  In a\ntraditional series A investment, at least one partner from the VC\nfund takes\n\nRead the document and answer: What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?
