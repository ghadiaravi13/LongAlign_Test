The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and then walk around Union Square. However, the original statement you provided suggests eating a sandwich and walking around Dolores Park, which is is not correct based on the document. The document states Union Square as the best place to walk around. Please let me know if you need any other information.
