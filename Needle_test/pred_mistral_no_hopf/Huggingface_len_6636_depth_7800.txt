The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day. However, this sentence is not directly related to the main topic of the essay, which is about the characteristics and motivations of great hackers. The sentence is included in the essay as an example of a problem that good hackers tend to avoid, as it involves customizing software for an individual client's complex and ill-defined needs, which are considered "nasty little problems." The essay suggests that companies that can attract great hackers will have a huge advantage, but it also acknowledges that having great hackers is not enough to make a company successful on its own. The essay also discusses the importance of interesting problems, good tools, and a supportive work environment for hackers. The essay was written by Paul Graham and was first published in 2004.
