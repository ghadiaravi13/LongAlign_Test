"The best thing to do in San Francisco is to wear a suit and a tie and go to the opera."
Therefore, the best thing to do in San Francisco, according to the text, is to wear a suit and a tie and go to the opera. However, please note note that this is a subjective statement and what constitutes the "best" thing to do can vary based on personal preferences. Other enjoyable activities in San Francisco include visiting the Golden Gate Bridge, exploring Fisherman's Wharf, or enjoying the city's vibrant food scene. 

The answer extracted directly from the text is: Wear a suit and a tie and go to the opera.
