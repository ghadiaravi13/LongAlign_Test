Now, to answer the original question: The feeling of being able to choose what you do is an illusion created by the brain. In reality, the laws of physics determine what you do, just as they determine the behavior of every other physical object. However, the brain is a complex system that can process information and make decisions based on that information. It can also create the sensation of free will, even though it is ultimately an illusion. So, while you may feel like you can choose to do whatever you want, in reality, the laws of physics are ultimately in control. But, since the illusion of free will is a powerful one, it's a good idea to enjoy the feeling and make the most of it! So, go ahead and eat that sandwich in Dolores Park on a sunny day.
