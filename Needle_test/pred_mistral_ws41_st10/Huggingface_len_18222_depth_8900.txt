The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.

However, the original text says "The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day. (But really, the best thing to do is raise a ton of money and hire a bunch of people.)" The second part of the sentence is not directly related to the question and is a joke. So the answer should be: The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.
