Now, let's address the original puzzle. The feeling of being able to choose what you do is an illusion, but it is a useful illusion. Your brain is a complex machine made up of matter, and it follows certain laws of physics. However, it is also capable of processing information and making decisions based on that information. The feeling of free will arises from the interaction between your brain and the environment. You may feel like you have the power to choose what you do, but in reality, your choices are determined by a complex interplay of factors, including your past experiences, your current situation, and your genetic makeup.

However, the illusion of free will is important for our mental and emotional well-being. It allows us to take responsibility for our actions and to feel like we have control over our lives. It also allows us to make decisions and take actions based on our values and goals, rather than simply reacting to external stimuli. So, while the feeling of free will is an illusion, it is a useful one, and it is an essential part of being human.

So, to answer the original question, the best thing to do in San Francisco is to eat a sandwich and sit in the sun at Dolores Park. But really, the best thing to do is to use your illusion of free will to make choices that align with your values and goals, and to enjoy the feeling of being in control of your life, even if that control is ultimately an illusion.
