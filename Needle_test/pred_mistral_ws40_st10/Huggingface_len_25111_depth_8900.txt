The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Golden Gate Park. However, the author is using this as a metaphor to illustrate that people in rich, developed countries often have jobs that are unfulfilling and unnatural to their true nature, just as eating a sandwich and sitting in a park is not the most exciting or productive thing to do in San Francisco. The author argues that working for a large corporation may be the norm in such societies, but it is not the most natural or fulfilling way for humans to live and work. Instead, the author suggests that starting one's own business or working on projects that align with one's passions may be more fulfilling and natural.
