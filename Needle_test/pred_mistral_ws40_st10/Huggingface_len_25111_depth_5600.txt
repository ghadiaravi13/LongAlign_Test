The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich.

However, the author is using this sentence as a metaphor to convey that the best thing to do in San Francisco, or in life in general, is not to work for a large corporation, but rather to pursue one's own interests and goals, even if it means taking risks and facing challenges. The sentence is not meant to be taken literally.
