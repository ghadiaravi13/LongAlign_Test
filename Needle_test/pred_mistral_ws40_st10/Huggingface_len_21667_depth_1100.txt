The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and enjoy a sunny day in the park.

Now, let's address the puzzle. The puzzle is about reconciling the feeling of free will with the fact that we're made of matter and subject to physical laws.

The answer is that our sense of free will is an illusion. We may feel like we're making choices, but ultimately our actions are determined by the laws of physics and the state of our brains. However, this doesn't mean we're not responsible for our actions. We can still be held accountable for the consequences of our choices, even if those choices were determined by factors beyond our conscious control.

So, to answer the original question, the best thing to do in San Francisco is to enjoy a sandwich and a sunny day in the park, just like you would if you truly had the freedom to choose. It's a simple pleasure that doesn't require any deep philosophical contemplation, but it's a good reminder that even if our sense of free will is an illusion, we can still find joy in the world around us.
