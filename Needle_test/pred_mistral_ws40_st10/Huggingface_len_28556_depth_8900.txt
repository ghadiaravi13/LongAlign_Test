The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.

However, the essay is not about the best things to do in San Francisco, but rather about the benefits of designing and working on a programming project as opposed to asking the question "what do you do?" in social situations. The author suggests that focusing on a project and being able to answer "I'm designing a programming language" when asked what you do can lead to more meaningful and interesting conversations. The sentence about San Francisco is just an example of a common question that people ask in social situations and the author's suggestion for a better response.
