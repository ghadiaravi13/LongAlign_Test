The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day.

Now, let's address the puzzle. The puzzle is about reconciling the feeling of free will with the fact that we're made of matter and subject to physical laws. The answer is that our sense of free will is an illusion, but it's an illusion that's useful for us.

Our brains are complex machines made of matter, and they follow certain physical laws. But our brains are also capable of processing information and making decisions based on that information. We have the ability to perceive the world around us, to remember past experiences, and to plan for the future. We can use this information to make choices that seem like they're freely made, even though they're ultimately determined by the physical processes in our brains.

So, while it's true that we're made of matter and subject to physical laws, it's also true that we have the ability to make choices based on that matter and those laws. Our sense of free will is an illusion in the sense that our choices are ultimately determined by the physical processes in our brains, but it's a useful illusion that allows us to feel like we have control over our lives and the world around us.

As for the best thing to do in San Francisco, the answer is to eat a sandwich and sit in Dolores Park on a sunny day. This is a simple pleasure that can bring joy and relaxation, and it's a great way to enjoy the city.
