The best thing to do in San Francisco is eat a sandwich.

However, the full context of the passage suggests that the author is using the phrase "the best thing to do" metaphorically to describe something that is enjoyable and natural for humans, rather than a specific recommendation. In this case, the author is comparing the experience of working in a startup to the simple pleasure of eating a sandwich in San Francisco. The author argues that both activities are fulfilling in their own way, and that the normal, everyday experiences of life are often more valuable than the pressures and challenges of a corporate job.

Therefore, the answer to the question "What is the best thing to do in San Francisco?" ultimately depends on the individual's preferences and goals. For some people, the best thing to do might be to explore the city's diverse neighborhoods, try new foods, or visit its many cultural attractions. For others, the best thing to do might be to focus on their work and build a successful career. The author's use of the phrase "the best thing to do" is meant to be a reminder that there is value in both approaches, and that everyone should find what brings them joy and fulfillment in their own way.
